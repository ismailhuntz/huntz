        <h2>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</h2>
        <p>The GDPR is a regulation in the European Union that governs how personal data is collected, processed, and stored. It gives individuals greater control over their personal data and imposes strict requirements on organizations to protect that data.</p>

    <section id="cpra">
        <h2>CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)</h2>
        <p>The CPRA is a law in California that enhances privacy rights for California residents. It builds on the earlier CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) by introducing new rights and obligations, such as the right to correct personal data and the establishment of a new category of sensitive personal information.</p>
        <p>The CPRA also creates the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) to enforce these privacy regulations and provide guidance to businesses and consumers.</p>
